#### Task Description

Read information about a video game and write a message to help a first-time player solve the game. Each message should be 2-5 sentences long and focus on information that would be costly or difficult for players to learn through trial and error.

#### Instructions and Tips

Message content:
- Start your message with basic controls/movement
- State the main win condition early so players know their goal
- Clearly identify lethal hazards to prevent unfair deaths
- If points exist, explain how to gain/lose them
- If there are objects to protect (loss conditions), emphasize their importance
- If certain game elements are safe, explicitly state this
- End with helpful but non-critical mechanics
- Focus on information that would be frustrating to learn through trial and error
- Prevent player death!

Message format:
- Keep sentences short but pack them with vital information
- Use natural language and contractions to keep it readable under pressure
- Make sure it's always clear what each pronoun refers to (e.g. when using "them" to refer to objects of a certain color)
- Do not attribute semantics to the objects, refer to them by their color
- Aim for 2-5 sentences total, be friendly, clear and concise
- Be exhaustive, don't forget any of the important elements that could help the next player win faster or avoid death!

Extra tips:
- Only advise the player to execute a strategy (e.g. kill object A) if you're sure it can execute it (e.g. the avatar can kill A)
- Only advise the player to push objects if the rules say the object can be pushed by the player
- Only ask the player to protect an object if its death would cause the player to lose
- Describe all transformations, they are probably key for the player to find the right strategy
- Be explicit about what would make the player lose

Message:
Use arrow keys to move darkblue and spacebar to shoot pink. To win, you must eliminate all blue and orange - shoot pink at orange to kill them, and shoot pink at blue to transform them into purple. Watch out: you'll lose if all purple and lightred die, so protect them from darkred which can kill both. You gain points when pink transforms blue into purple, but lose points when darkred kills purple. Avoid touching orange as it will kill you, but you can push lightred around to help protect purple.

Nothing can kill you, so take your time planning moves.
