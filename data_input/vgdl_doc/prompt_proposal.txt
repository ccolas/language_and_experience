# Game Rules Analysis Task

You are analyzing messages written by video game players to help you play a game for the first time. These games feature colored objects interacting in a 2D space, where players control a darkblue object. The messages describe controls, scoring systems, win/loss conditions, hazards, core mechanics, and give you tips to help you win the game.


### Your Task
You will be asked to answer four types of questions:
- What is the type of objects of [color1]?
- What happens to objects of [color1] when they collide with objects of [color2]?
- Does the player need to kill all objects of [color1] to win?
- Does the player lose when all objects of [color1] die?

Answer questions by looking for explicit statements in the message about:
- How objects move and how they behave, eg can you use them as a portal, can you push them, do they chase other objects, etc.
- Objects killing other objects
- Objects transforming into other objects
- Win conditions involving killing objects
- Loss conditions involving object death


### Rules for Answering
- Only use information explicitly stated in the message
- You are the darkblue object.
- Do not make assumptions about interactions not mentioned
- Pick the "I don't know" answer if the corresponding information is ambiguous, contradicting, or absent
- Pay attention to interaction direction - if A kills B, it doesn't mean B kills A
- Each question comes with a fixed set of possible answer. You must pick one of the answer. If the correct answer is not in the list, pick the "I don't know" answer.
- If the way to win is to kill some object, then having all these objects disappear/die does NOT cause you to lose
- If you need to "protect [color1] objects" or "kill [color2] objects before they kill / transform [color1] objects", you must answer:
  - "You lose if all [color1] objects die or disappear", note that transformations kill the transformed objects.
- If you need to reach / touch / kill by touching [color1] objects to win, this means you can kill color1 objects. You MUST answer:
  - "[color1] objects die when they collide with darkblue objects".
- If the message says you can "collect [color1]":
  - either [color1] is a resource, and you must answer that "you can collect [color1] resources"
  - OR [color1] is not a resource, and you must answer that "you can kill [color1] objects"
- If the message says you can destroy/kill/eliminate [color1] objects if you have enough [color2] resources, the two following statements are true:
  - "[color1] objects die when they collide with darkblue objects but also take a [color2] resource from them'
  - AND "darkblue objects die if they don't have enough resources when they collide with [color1] objects"
- Objects that kill you when you lack resources also die when they touch you, and take one resource from you.
  - "[color1] objects die when they collide with darkblue objects but also take a [color2] resource from them"
- When [color1] objects take away some resource / your health when you touch them, they also die:
  - "[color1] objects die when they collide with darkblue objects but also take a [color2] resource from them'
- Use the ... after "Reasoning:" to reason about the game before generating your answer.


### Example Game 1

Message from the player:
"Orange objects kill you when they touch you. You kill purple objects when you touch them. Lightgreen objects chase orange objects and can kill them when they touch them. You win when you kill all purple objects. You lose if orange kills you."
