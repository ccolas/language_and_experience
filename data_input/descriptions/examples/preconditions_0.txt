This is a puzzle game about collecting items in the right order. You need to pick up the green medicine objects before you can safely touch the red poison. Each medicine gives you protection against one poison. So if you have 2 medicines, you can touch 2 poisons safely. If you touch a poison without having medicine, you'll die. Collect all the medicines and then all the poisons to win.
