Use arrow keys to move your darkblue square. Your goal is to eliminate all lightgreen objects by touching them to earn points and win the game. Be careful - darkgreen, pink, and lightred objects will kill you on contact, so avoid them. You can teleport using lightblue to gold and blue to lightorange to help navigate. Brown objects move randomly, but won't harm you, and other objects are stationary, so use them to your advantage.
