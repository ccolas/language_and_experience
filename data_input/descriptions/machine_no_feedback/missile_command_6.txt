Use arrow keys to move your darkblue and spacebar to shoot pink. To win, eliminate all red and gold - shoot pink at them to kill them. You'll gain points for each red or gold killed by pink, but lose points if green objects die, so protect them from red and gold which chase and kill them on contact. Green objects also kill red and gold, but you'll lose points for these interactions, so focus on shooting pink at red and gold instead.
