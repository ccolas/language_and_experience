Use left and right arrow keys to move your darkblue square. To win, eliminate all orange, pink, and brown - shoot blue at pink to kill them, but watch out as pink can kill you on contact. You also lose points if red objects kill you, so avoid them. You gain points when blue kills pink, and you can also kill white objects with blue. Be aware that white objects can kill red, and blue objects can kill white, but also kill each other, so plan carefully.
