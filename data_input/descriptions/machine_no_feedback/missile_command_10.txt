Use arrow keys to move your darkblue square and spacebar to shoot pink squares. To win, eliminate all red and gold objects by shooting pink at them, earning you points, while keeping all green alive - they die if they touch red or gold. Protect green from red and gold, which chase them, and avoid letting green and red/gold kill each other, as this loses you points. Since nothing can kill you, focus on strategy and protecting green to win the game.
