Use left and right arrow keys to move your darkblue square and spacebar to shoot blue squares. To win, eliminate all orange, pink, and brown - shooting blue at pink will kill them and earn points, but watch out as pink can kill you on contact. Protect yourself from pink and red, which can also kill you, and avoid touching them. Blue objects can help by killing pink, but be aware that blue and white objects kill each other, and pink can generate more red objects.
