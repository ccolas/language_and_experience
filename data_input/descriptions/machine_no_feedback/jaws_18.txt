Move your darkblue square with arrow keys. Your goal is to survive as long as possible. Be careful: orange, brown, and pink objects will kill you on contact, so keep an eye on them - orange will even chase you! Since you can't do anything special, focus on avoiding these hazards and staying alive. Darkgray, purple, and green objects are harmless, so you can use them as barriers or hiding spots if needed.
