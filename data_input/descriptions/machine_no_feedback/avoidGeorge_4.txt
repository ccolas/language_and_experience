Use arrow keys to control your darkblue square and spacebar to shoot brown. To win, survive long enough while keeping green objects alive - they can be created by shooting brown at purple or letting orange touch purple. Watch out: lightblue objects will kill you on contact and can also turn green back into purple, so protect your green! You'll earn points when brown or orange transform purple into green, but lose points if lightblue kills you.
