Use arrow keys to move your darkblue square and spacebar to shoot brown. To win, survive long enough and keep all green objects alive - they can be created by shooting brown at purple or by orange touching purple. Watch out: lightblue will kill you on contact and can also transform green back into purple, so protect your green from them. You can transform blue into orange by shooting brown at them, which can help create more green.
