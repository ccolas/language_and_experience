Use arrow keys to move your darkblue square. To win, focus on survival while helping brown and orange objects transform purple into green - shoot brown at purple to transform them yourself, or let orange objects do it by touching them. You'll gain points for each transformation, but beware of lightblue objects, which will kill you on contact and can also turn green back into purple. Protect your green objects, as their death means game over.
