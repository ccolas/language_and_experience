Use arrow keys to move your darkblue square. Your goal is to eliminate all lightgreen by touching them to earn points. Be careful - darkgreen, pink, and lightred will kill you on contact, so avoid them! You can teleport from lightblue to gold and from blue to lightorange to help navigate the space and reach lightgreen safely. If you die, you lose the game, so plan your moves carefully.
