Use arrow keys to move your darkblue square and spacebar to shoot brown. To win, survive as long as possible while keeping green objects alive - you lose if all green die. You can help by shooting brown at purple to transform them into green, earning points. Watch out for lightblue, which will kill you on contact and can also turn green back into purple. Orange objects can also help by converting purple to green, so try to keep them safe too.
