Use arrow keys to move the darkblue square and spacebar to shoot lightred. To win, you must eliminate all purple, orange, brown, and lightblue while keeping yellow and red alive - shoot lightred at orange and brown to kill them. You'll gain points when lightred and orange or brown kill each other, and when you transform green into yellow or blue into red by touching them. However, you'll lose points when orange or brown transform yellow into green, or when blue kills orange or brown, so be strategic. Nothing can kill you, so focus on manipulating the other objects to
