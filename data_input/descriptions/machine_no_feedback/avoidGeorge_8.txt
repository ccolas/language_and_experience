Use arrow keys to move your darkblue square and spacebar to shoot brown. Your goal is to survive long enough to win, but watch out - lightblue objects will kill you on contact! To gain points, help brown and orange transform purple into green - shoot brown at purple or let orange touch them. Protect green, as you'll lose if they all die, and be careful as lightblue can convert them back into purple.
