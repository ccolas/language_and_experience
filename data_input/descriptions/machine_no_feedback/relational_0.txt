Use arrow keys to move your darkblue. To win, eliminate all blue by pushing them onto yellow. You'll get points when blue and yellow kill each other, and you can also transform red into yellow, pink into orange, and orange into yellow by pushing it onto purple. Watch out - white will kill you on contact! You can push blue, orange, and other objects to set up kills, but be careful not to touch white.
