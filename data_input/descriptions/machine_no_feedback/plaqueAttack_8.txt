Control the darkblue square with arrow keys and shoot lightred with spacebar. To win, eliminate all purple, orange, brown, and lightblue while keeping yellow and red alive. You'll earn points when lightred kill orange or brown, and when you transform green to yellow or blue to red, but lose points when orange or brown transform yellow to green, or when blue kill orange or brown. Protect yellow from orange and brown, and avoid transforming red to blue. Nothing can kill you, so focus on manipulating the objects to your advantage.
