Use arrow keys to move your darkblue square. To win, eliminate all green objects by touching them, earning points in the process. Be careful not to touch yellow or orange objects, as they'll kill you. You can also kill red and purple objects by touching them, but that's not necessary to win. Lightgreen objects can help you by killing yellow and orange, so try to use them to your advantage.
