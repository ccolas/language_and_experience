Use arrow keys to move your darkblue square and spacebar to shoot lightred. To win, you need to eliminate all purple, orange, brown, and lightblue objects while keeping yellow and red alive. You'll gain points when lightred and orange/brown kill each other, and when you transform green into yellow or blue into red. Protect yellow as orange and brown can transform them into green, and avoid touching orange or brown with your blue square as it'll cost you points. Nothing can kill you, so focus on manipulating objects to your advantage.
