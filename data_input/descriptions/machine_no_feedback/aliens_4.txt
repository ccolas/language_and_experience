Control the darkblue square's horizontal position with left and right arrow keys, and shoot blue squares with spacebar. To win, you must eliminate all orange, pink, and brown - shoot blue at pink to kill them, but watch out as pink can kill you on contact. You'll also lose points if red objects kill you, so avoid them. Blue objects can kill pink, earning you points, but be careful as blue and white objects kill each other. Pink objects generate red, which also kills you, so prioritize eliminating pink.
