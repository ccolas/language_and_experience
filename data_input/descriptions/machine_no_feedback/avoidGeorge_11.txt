Use arrow keys to move your darkblue square. To survive and win, transform purple objects into green by shooting brown at purple, or let orange do it by touching purple. You'll also earn points by transforming blue to orange with brown shots. Watch out for lightblue, which will kill you on contact and can also turn green back into purple. Protect your green objects, as you lose if all of them die.
