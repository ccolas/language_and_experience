Use arrow keys to move your darkblue. Your goal is to survive as long as possible. Watch out - orange, brown, and pink objects will kill you on contact, so avoid them at all costs. Orange objects will actively chase you, while brown and pink move in fixed directions. Stay safe and use the stationary darkgray, purple, and green objects to your advantage to block or distract the deadly objects.
