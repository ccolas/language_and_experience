Control the darkblue square with arrow keys and shoot brown with spacebar. To win, survive as long as you can while helping green objects thrive - brown can transform purple into green, and orange can too by touching purple. You'll lose if all green die, so protect them from lightblue which can kill you and convert green back into purple. Avoid touching lightblue to stay alive, and use brown to transform blue into orange for more green conversions.
