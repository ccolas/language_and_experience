Use arrow keys to move your darkblue square. To win, eliminate all blue objects, which can be done by pushing them onto yellow objects - when they kill each other, you gain points. Be careful not to touch white objects, as they'll kill you. You can also transform objects to help your strategy: touch red to turn them into yellow, touch pink to turn them into orange, and push orange onto purple to turn them into yellow.
