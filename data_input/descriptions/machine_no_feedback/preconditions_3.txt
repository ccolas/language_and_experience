Use arrow keys to control the darkblue square. Your goal is to kill all gold objects to win, earning points for each one you eliminate by touching them. Be careful, as green objects will kill you on contact if you don't have enough white resources to protect yourself - collect white resources to stay safe. You can also kill green objects by touching them, but they'll take one of your white resources in the process.
