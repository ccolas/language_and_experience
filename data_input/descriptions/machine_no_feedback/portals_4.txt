Use arrow keys to move your darkblue and teleport between lightblue to gold or blue to lightorange. To win, eliminate all lightgreen by touching them, earning points along the way. Be careful - darkgreen, pink, and lightred will kill you on contact, so avoid them. Brown objects move randomly, but are harmless. If you die, you lose the game, so plan your moves carefully and use teleportation to your advantage.
