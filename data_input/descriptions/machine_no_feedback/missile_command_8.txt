Use arrow keys to move your darkblue square and spacebar to shoot pink. Your goal is to eliminate all red and gold objects by shooting pink at them to earn points. Watch out for interactions between other objects: red and gold will kill green when they touch, which costs you points and can lead to a loss if all green die. Since nothing can kill you, focus on using pink to take out red and gold while keeping green safe.
