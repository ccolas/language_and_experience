Use arrow keys to move your darkblue and spacebar to shoot pink. To win, you must eliminate all red and gold - shoot pink at them to kill them. You'll earn points when pink kills red or gold, but you'll lose points when green and red or green and gold kill each other, so try to prevent those interactions. You lose if all green die, so be careful not to let them get killed. Nothing can kill you, so focus on protecting green and using pink to clear the field.
