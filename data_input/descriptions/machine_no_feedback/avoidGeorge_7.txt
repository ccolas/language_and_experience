Control the darkblue square with arrow keys and shoot brown objects with spacebar. To win, survive long enough while keeping green objects alive - they can be created when brown or orange objects transform purple objects. Watch out for lightblue objects, as they'll kill you on contact and can also convert green back to purple. You can help create green by shooting brown at purple, and transform blue to orange to aid in this process. Protect green objects from lightblue to succeed.
