Use arrow keys to move darkblue and spacebar to shoot lightred. Your goal is to eliminate all purple, orange, brown, and lightblue. You'll gain points when lightred and orange or brown kill each other, and by transforming green into yellow or blue into red. Protect yellow and red, as their death will lose the game. Be strategic with your transformations and lightred shots to maximize points, and avoid unnecessary transformations that could cost you points, such as turning blue into orange or brown.
