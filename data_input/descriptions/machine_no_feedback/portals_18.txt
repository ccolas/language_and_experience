Use arrow keys to move your darkblue square. To win, eliminate all lightgreen objects by touching them, and you'll earn points. Be careful - darkgreen, pink, and lightred objects will kill you on contact, so avoid them. You can teleport from lightblue to gold or from blue to lightorange to navigate safely. Brown objects move randomly, but they won't harm you, and you can use them to your advantage.
