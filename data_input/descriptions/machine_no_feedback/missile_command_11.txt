Use arrow keys to move your darkblue and spacebar to shoot pink. To win, eliminate all red and gold by shooting pink at them - you'll gain points for each one you kill. Watch out: red and gold will kill green if they touch, and green will die if they touch each other or gold, so try to keep them separate. Since nothing can kill you, take your time, and focus on shooting pink at red and gold while protecting green.
