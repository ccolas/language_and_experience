Control your darkblue square with arrow keys. Your goal is to kill all gold objects by touching them to earn points and win. Be careful, as green objects will kill you if you touch them without enough white resources to protect yourself. Collect white resources to safeguard against green objects, and use them to kill green if needed, but note that killing green will cost you a resource.
