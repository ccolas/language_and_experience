Control the darkblue square with arrow keys. To win, eliminate all blue objects - push them onto yellow to kill them. You'll gain points when blue and yellow kill each other. But watch out: touching white objects will kill you, so steer clear. You can also transform red into yellow, pink into orange, and orange into yellow by pushing orange onto purple - these can help you in your goal.
