Control your darkblue square with arrow keys and shoot lightred with spacebar. To win, you need to eliminate all purple, orange, brown, and lightblue - focus on shooting lightred at orange and brown, and use your touch to transform blue into red. You'll lose if all yellow or red die, so protect them from orange and brown, which can transform yellow into green. You gain points when lightred and orange/brown kill each other, and when you transform green to yellow or blue to red, but be careful not to let blue kill orange or brown, or you'll lose
