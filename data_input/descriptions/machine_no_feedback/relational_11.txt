Use arrow keys to move your darkblue. To win, eliminate all blue objects by pushing them onto yellow objects. You'll gain points when blue and yellow kill each other. Be careful not to touch white objects, as they'll kill you. You can transform red into yellow, pink into orange, and orange into yellow by pushing orange onto purple - use these to your advantage, but prioritize avoiding white and pushing blue onto yellow.
