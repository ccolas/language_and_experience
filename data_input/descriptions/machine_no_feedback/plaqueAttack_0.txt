Use arrow keys to move your darkblue square and spacebar to shoot lightred. Your goal is to eliminate all purple, orange, brown, and lightblue objects while keeping yellow and red alive. You'll earn points when lightred and orange or brown kill each other, and when you transform green into yellow or blue into red by touching them. Be careful, as orange and brown can transform yellow into green and you'll lose points when this happens, so try to kill them with lightred first.
