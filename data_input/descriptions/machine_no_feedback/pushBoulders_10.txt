Use arrow keys to move your darkblue square. To win, kill all gold objects - you can do this by touching them or by pushing green objects onto them, and you'll even get points when green objects kill gold on their own. Watch out for orange and pink, as they'll kill you on contact. You can also kill lightblue objects by touching or pushing green onto them, but be careful not to touch orange or pink in the process.
