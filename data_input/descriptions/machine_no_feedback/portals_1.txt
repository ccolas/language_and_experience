Use arrow keys to move the darkblue square. Your goal is to eliminate all lightgreen objects by touching them to earn points and win. Be careful - darkgreen, pink, and lightred will kill you on contact! You can teleport from lightblue to gold and from blue to lightorange to navigate safely. Brown objects move randomly, but aren't deadly, so keep an eye out for them while avoiding the lethal objects.
