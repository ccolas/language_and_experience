Control the darkblue square's horizontal position with left and right arrow keys, and shoot blue squares with spacebar. To win, eliminate all orange, pink, and brown - shoot blue at pink to kill them, and use blue to kill white which can also kill pink. Be careful: pink and red objects will kill you on contact, so avoid them. You'll lose points if you die, but gain points when blue kills pink, so prioritize protecting yourself and using blue effectively.
