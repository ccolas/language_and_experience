Use arrow keys to move your darkblue square. To win, eliminate all lightgreen objects by touching them, earning you points. Be careful - touching darkgreen, pink, or lightred objects will kill you. You can teleport from lightblue to gold and from blue to lightorange to help navigate. Brown objects move randomly, but aren't deadly, so keep an eye out for them while focusing on killing lightgreen.
