Use arrow keys to move the darkblue square and spacebar to shoot lightred. Your goal is to eliminate all purple, orange, brown, and lightblue - you can kill orange and brown by shooting lightred at them. Protect yellow and red objects, as you'll lose if either die, and focus on transforming green into yellow and blue into red to gain points. You'll also gain points when lightred and orange/brown kill each other, so try to set up these interactions.
