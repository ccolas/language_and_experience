Control the darkblue square with arrow keys and teleport using lightblue to gold or blue to lightorange. To win, eliminate all lightgreen by touching them - you'll earn points for each one killed. Be careful, as darkgreen, pink, and lightred objects will kill you on contact, so plan your moves to avoid them. You can use teleportation to your advantage, but don't forget to keep an eye on moving pink, lightred, and brown objects to stay safe.
