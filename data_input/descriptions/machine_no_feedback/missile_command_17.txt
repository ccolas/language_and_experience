Control the darkblue square with arrow keys and shoot pink squares with spacebar. To win, eliminate all red and gold - shoot pink at them to kill. Watch out: red and gold will kill green on contact, so try to avoid this as you'll lose points and the game if all green die. However, you gain points when pink kills red and gold, so focus on shooting them. Nothing can kill you, so take your time planning moves.
