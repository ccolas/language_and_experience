Control the darkblue square with arrow keys. Your goal is to kill all gold objects by touching them, earning points along the way. Watch out for green objects - touching them will kill you unless you have white resources to protect yourself. Collect white resources to safeguard against green, and use them to kill green objects if needed, but be aware that each kill will cost a resource.
