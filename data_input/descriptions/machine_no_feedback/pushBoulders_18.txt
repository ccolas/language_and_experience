Use arrow keys to move your darkblue square. To win, eliminate all gold objects by touching them or pushing green onto them - you'll earn points for each gold destroyed. Be careful: touching orange or pink will kill you. Green is a valuable ally, as it can also kill gold and earn you points, so use it to your advantage by pushing it onto gold. Protect yourself and keep pushing green to clear the way to victory, as dying means losing the game.
