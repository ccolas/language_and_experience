Use left and right arrow keys to control the darkblue square and spacebar to shoot blue. To win, eliminate all orange, pink, and brown - shoot blue at pink to kill them and earn points. Be careful: pink and red objects will kill you on contact, so avoid them. You'll also lose points if they kill you. You can use blue to kill white objects, but watch out for collisions between blue and white, as they'll kill each other.
