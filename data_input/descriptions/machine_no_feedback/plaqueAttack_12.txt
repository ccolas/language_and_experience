Control the darkblue square with arrow keys and shoot lightred with spacebar. To win, eliminate all purple, orange, brown, and lightblue - you can help by shooting lightred at orange and brown. You'll also earn points when lightred and orange/brown kill each other. Protect yellow and red, as you lose if they die. You can transform green into yellow and blue into red by touching them, earning points, but avoid touching orange or brown with blue to prevent losing points.
