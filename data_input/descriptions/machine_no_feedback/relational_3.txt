Control the darkblue square with arrow keys. Your goal is to eliminate all blue objects, and you get points when blue and yellow objects kill each other. To kill blue, push them onto yellow objects, but watch out for white objects - they'll kill you on contact! You can also transform objects to your advantage: touch red to turn them into yellow, touch pink to turn them into orange, and push orange onto purple to turn them into yellow.
