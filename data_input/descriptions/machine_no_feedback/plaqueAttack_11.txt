Control the darkblue square with arrow keys and shoot lightred with spacebar. To win, eliminate all purple, orange, brown, and lightblue while keeping yellow and red alive - you'll lose if either of these die. You can kill orange and brown by shooting lightred at them, and transform blue into red or green into yellow by touching them. Note that orange and brown can convert yellow to green, so protect your yellow! Also, blue can kill orange and brown, and orange and brown can convert red to blue, so be strategic.
