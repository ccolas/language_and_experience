Use arrow keys to move your darkblue square and spacebar to shoot brown. To win, survive as long as possible while keeping green objects alive - they can be created when brown or orange transform purple objects. Protect green from lightblue, which will convert them back to purple and chase them. You'll lose if all green die, so help create more by shooting brown at purple or letting orange transform them. Watch out for lightblue, as touching them will kill you and cost you points.
