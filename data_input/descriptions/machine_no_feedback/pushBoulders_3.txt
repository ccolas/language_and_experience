Use arrow keys to move your darkblue. Your goal is to eliminate all gold - you can kill them by touching them or by pushing green onto them. You'll earn points for killing gold, and also when green kills gold, so use them strategically. Watch out - orange and pink will kill you on contact, so avoid them. You can also kill lightblue by touching or pushing green onto it, but be careful not to push green into orange or pink.
