This game is about moving blocks beside or on top of other blocks of a different color.This is done by pushing them with your dark blue block. It seems you should start with the orange block and move it beside other colors to see if they change color if so try to place them on top of that block if it will not go move to a white block and it should disappear. Then move the remaining unchanged color to the block that you just changed with the orange block.
