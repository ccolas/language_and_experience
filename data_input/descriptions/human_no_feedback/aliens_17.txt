This game is very easy. You don't need to use the arrow keys at all. Immediately upon start, press the space bar very fast to shoot, and take out the pink. If you shoot very fast continually, you will take out all the pink, and the red can't kill you, but if you slack, the red or pink might get you. You can move blue around with the arrow keys if you want, but it's not necessary if you keep a constant press of the space bar.
