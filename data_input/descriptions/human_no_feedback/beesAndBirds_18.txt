All that you will need to use on your keyboard are the 4 arrow keys to move your dark blue square.  The goal is to get your dark blue over the dark green.  Do not touch yellow or orange as they will kill you.  Not sure about the red because I never touched it.  In the second game, move your dark blue to the purple to release the light green.  The light green will eliminate the orange barrier to move your dark blue to the dark green.  In the 3rd game, move your dark blue around to release the light green so it can eliminate the orange. The black is just a barrier but doesn't do anything to hurt you.
