This is a time-based game wherein you need to try to keep the five GREEN tiles from turning PURPLE. which is the goal of your enemy, the LIGHTBLUE tile. The game starts and the LIGHTBLUE tile will start moving towards all your green tiles to turn them purple by interacting with them and the best advice I can give you is do not panic since after a certain amount of time, as long as you have one GREEN tile, you will win the game. You need to be actively changing the PURPLE tiles to green that have been converted by the LIGHTBLUE tile by interacting with them with the SPACEBAR key while avoiding being touched by the LIGHTBLUE tile or avoiding any of the outside and inside DARKGRAY walls. If you see another DARKBLUE tile that looks like you, don't interact with it, I can't confidently say what it does, but it will just be distracting.
