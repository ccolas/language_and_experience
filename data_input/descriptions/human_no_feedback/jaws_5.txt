Move Darkblue with arrow keys. Orange will slowly follow Darkblue for the entire round. Lightblue and Lightgreen will be shooting Brown and Pink across the screen. Warning: Running Darkblue into any of these colors other than Lightblue will result in a loss of life. Move Darkblue slowly around the open areas and avoid Orange for as long as possible. You must survive long enough to win the game.
