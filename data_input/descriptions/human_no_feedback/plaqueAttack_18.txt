The goal is to keep all the blocks that are in a straight line from getting changed. They change when the moving blocks touch them.Their may also be random brown blocks that move erratically around in the center of the screen. You can keep the blocks from staying changed by simply going back and forth across the straight row clicking the space bar but you must collect the brown blocks when you get a chance.
