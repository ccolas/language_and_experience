Use arrow keys to move Darkblue left and right. Press Spacebar to shoot Lightblue up. The objective is to shoot the lightblue at the pinks that start from the top right and move slowly across the screen. You get points for each pink removed. I found it helpful to find cover and shoot through the top of it so I can move into cover from both sides. Watch out: Pink will shoot back Red at you. Avoid letting red touch you.
