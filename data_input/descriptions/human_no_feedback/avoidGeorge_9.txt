DarkBlue Square(You) moves(Arrows) across the map.

You create a BrownSquare(SpaceBar) in the direction you move towards, transforming purple squares into green squares.

LightBlue Square(Enemy) will transform Green Squares into purple squares(Resource).

Your goal is to avoid the LightBlue Square(Loss), while making sure at least one green square remains until time(unseen) is up.

If the DarkBlue Squares(Ally) touch the brown squares, they will change into orange squares, and will travel the map and transform squares for you.
