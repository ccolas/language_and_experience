So the main goal is to protect the GREEN tiles by making sure the RED tiles and the YELLOW tiles don't touch them and you can win even if you only have ONE GREEN tile left. As soon as you click START, they will start moving and you need to act fast by trying to interact with the RED and YELLOW tiles to make them disappear using the SPACEBAR while next to them. The YELLOW tiles move faster than the red so try to prioritize them if possible but there will be times that you would need to sacrifice one GREEN tile to make one YELLOW tile disappear because at that same time, you can possibly eliminate 2-3 RED tiles because they are slower. You win the level by keeping at least one GREEN tile intact and you lose when you lose all five of them.
