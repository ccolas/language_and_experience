Just use the 4 arrow keys and the spacebar but I never found use for the space bar.  You are the dark blue square and you move it with your arrows.  The goal is to push the blue squares into yellow squares.  If there are no yellow squares shown, you need to move the orange squares into the purple squares to make them yellow.  Then push the blue into the yellow.  This is for all 4 levels.  Good luck!
