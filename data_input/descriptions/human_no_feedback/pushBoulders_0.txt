So the main goal of the game is to get to the YELLOW tile by moving the DARKBLUE tile through the maze while avoiding passing ORANGE and PINK tiles. If one of those tiles is in your way, you can use the GREEN tile to push them to the side until you make an opening to get to the next area. If you see LIGHTBLUE tiles in your way, just pass them, they will disappear and you can keep going. You will immediately lose the level as soon as you pass an ORANGE or PINK tile, you can be next to it, but you can't go over it or pass it.
