I never figured out the game.  Use the 4 arrow keys to move your dark blue square and the spacebar is supposed to do something too, but it never did for me.  The light blue square is making all the green squares turn dark blue when it touches them.  When all the green squares turn dark blue, the game is over.  I couldn't stop the light blue square.  It killed me when I touched it too. Good luck!
