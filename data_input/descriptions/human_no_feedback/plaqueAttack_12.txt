Move the darkblue square with the arrow keys on the keyboard. The goal of this game is to protect the yellow and red squares from the moving orange and brown squares. To remove the orange and brown squares, control the darkblue square to face the orange and brown squares and then press the spacebar to shoot a projectile. If the projectile hits an orange or a brown square, it will eliminate it. You gain a point for each successful elimination. You will lose if all squares are captured and turn into green squares.
