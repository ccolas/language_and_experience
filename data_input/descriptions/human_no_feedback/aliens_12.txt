Control the darkblue square with the arrow keys on the keyboard, and shoot a projectile in a straight line toward the top of the screen by pressing the spacebar. The moving pink squares will shoot red squares in a straight line as the pink squares move horizontally across the screen from the top to the bottom in a snake-like pattern. If the red squares hit a white square, it will eliminate both the white square and the red square. Avoid getting hit by the red squares or you will lose a life. In order to win the game, press the spacebar to shoot projectiles at the pink squares. You win when all pink squares are eliminated.
