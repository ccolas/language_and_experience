The Dark Blue Square(You) moves(using arrows) across the bottom of the map while firing shots(Spacebar) towards the pink squares(Enemies) that fly across the screen.

The pink squares are dropping red squares(deadly) on you and your white shields(resources) while the pink squares are trying to reach the bottom by moving down one row at a time.

Your goal is to destroy the pink squares, the orange and brown squares creating the pink squares disappear on their own, they can't be destroyed.

You can shoot through your own shields to aim and prepare shots and to move behind them as cover.

I recommend staying in one spot while firing, only to move to avoid red squares, and to reposition your shots so they line up with the enemy.
