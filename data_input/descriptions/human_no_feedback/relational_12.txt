You control the darkblue square with the arrow keys on the keyboard. The objective of the game is to clear all of blocks from the map except for the darkgray, white, and darkblue squares. To do this, you can push the blue blocks into the yellow blocks to eliminate both of them. If there are orange and purple squares on the screen, you can transform the purple squares into yellow squares by pushing the orange squares into them. Avoid pushing your blocks into the walls because they will get stuck and you will lose a life and have to restart the level.
