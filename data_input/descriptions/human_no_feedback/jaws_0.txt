The main goal of the game is to survive by avoiding getting the DARKBLUE tile (controlled by you), hit by the BROWN, PINK and ORANGE tiles by moving around with the ARROW keys. The BROWN And PINK tiles will behave the same way throughout, but the ORANGE tile seems to be like a slow homing missile because it freely moves, and it will move in the same direction you are going. Where you go doesn't matter, try to stay within the big open areas but when the ORANGE tile is closing in on you, you need to move because you don't want to get trapped. You lose by being touched by the BROWN, PINK and ORANGE tiles and you win by surviving after a certain amount of time.
