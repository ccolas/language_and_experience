This game is a mix of tag and frogger. You have to stay away from every other block on the board and one is chasing you. My strategy was go all the way to the top corner closest to the side I was on first then as the chasing block got closer I would rapidly move to the other side using my arrow keys. I did notice that the chaser gets faster and at times I had to wait for an opening to go to the bottom and wait till the chaser got close again before moving to the other side. A tip would be do not go all the way in the corner after the initial time or you may not have an opening.
