Use the arrow keys to move the dark blue block around the screen. Avoid going over the white blocks but you may need to push blocks into the white at times. Try different combinations of pushing blocks into each other until you create yellow blocks. After you have figured out how to create yellow blocks you should then be able to push the remaining colored blocks into those yellow blocks and once all them are gone the level is completed.
