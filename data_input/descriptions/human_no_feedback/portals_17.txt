I was able to win at all 4 levels!  The only keys you will need are the 4 arrow keys and the spacebar.  The spacebar did not help me at all.  The goal is to get your dark blue square over the light green square.  That is how you win.  You need to avoid all the red squares because they will kill you instantly.  Try to get your dark blue square over the other dark blue squares to get into the area of the light green.  Avoid the red.  Good luck!
