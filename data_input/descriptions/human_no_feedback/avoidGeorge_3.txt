You will have to move very quickly with the left, right, up and down arrow keys to each of the purple squares and press the space bar near them to turn them green. Any purple squares you see must be turned to green. There will be a competing light blue square that will be moving around turning the green squares into purple. You need to make sure at least once square is green the entire time. Once a certain amount of time is passed, you will win.
