You'll start with 15 lives and have 4 levels to beat in each game. Use the arrow keys to move and the spacebar to interact. Your goal is to win each level by completing specific objectives, like removing certain colored blocks or reaching a specific point. Be careful, as failing a level will cost you a life. 
Game 1-4: Use the arrow keys to move the darkblue square. Press the spacebar to shoot a red square. Protect the yellow squares from the orange by shooting them with the red square. You can also shoot the brown squares to clear them.
