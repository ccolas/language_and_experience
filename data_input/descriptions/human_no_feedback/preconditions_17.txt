In the first game, use the arrow keys to push the dark blue square into the white square. This white square will give you the power you need to take out the bottom left, green square, but only the bottom portion which parallels the red. After that, push dark blue square into red square. Now move up to merge with yellow. You have won the first game.


In the second game, use the arrow keys to push the dark blue square over to the top left, white square. This white square will give you the power to take out green squares, but only one at a time. This second game is more complex, and I did not win the second game, but I can tell you the parts I got right. After you merge with the first white square, do not take out the green square next to it. Instead, move down below to take out the bottom left green square. Now you can gain more power from the second white square. Go back up to take out the top green square, then come back down to take out another bottom left green square. You need to merge with one white square before you can take out a green square. I'm not sure how to win this one. Maybe you'll do better than me.
