The main goal of the game is to protect the YELLOW tile by shooting ORANGE and BROWN tiles before they hit them just like Space Invaders. The attacks could come from the top and the bottom of the screen, there will be holes from where the ORANGE and BROWN tiles will come from. There is a set amount of ORANGE and BROWN tiles that will come out so just keep shooting them until you don't see any more coming out and that will also end up with you winning the level. You shoot them by pressing SPACEBAR and whatever direction on the ARROW KEY the attack is coming from and don't forget that you can shoot sideways. The game ends when all the YELLOW tiles have been hit and turned to GREEN.
