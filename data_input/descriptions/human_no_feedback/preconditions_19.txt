In this game your objective is to get to the yellow block. You can only do this by collecting white blocks before you cross a green block. You cancel on green block in your way for every white block you collect. You can collect multiple white blocks at once. You lose if you try to cross a green block without a white dot in your shield bar that you receive when you collect a white block.
