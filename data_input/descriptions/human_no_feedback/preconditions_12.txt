You can control the darkblue square by using the arrow keys on the keyboard. To win the game, you must touch the gold square with the darkblue square while avoiding touching the green squares. You will lose if you touch a green square. In order to safely eliminate green squares from the map, collect the white squares first. For every white square you pass over, it will store a charge on the darkblue square that will allow it to eliminate one green square.
