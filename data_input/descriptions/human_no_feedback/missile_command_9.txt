Dark Blue Square(You) moves(using arrows) around the map.

You create a Pink Square(Spacebar) in the direction you last moved, to capture Red and Yellow squares that are moving towards the green squares.

When green squares(resource) touch a square, they vanish, and you lose if they all disappear.

Move around the map, and rapidly press the space bar and start moving through red and yellow squares.

The game ends when all the red and yellow squares are gone(Victory).
