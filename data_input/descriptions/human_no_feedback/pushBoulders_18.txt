The goal is to get the dark blue square that you control into the yellow square.  You need to avoid the orange squares as they will kill you.  You can also push the green squares into the orange to turn them green.  In the later levels, just move your dark blue square through the maze to get to yellow.  Pus the green at anytime move the orange.  Just use the 4 arrow keys on your keyboard.  Good luck!
